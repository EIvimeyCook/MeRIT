Simply insert a statement saying, for instance: <br>

<h3> In your methods </h3>
<br>

"We provide author initials as per the MeRIT system (Nakagawa et al 2023)". <br>
or <br>
"EIC conducted the fieldwork (note we use the MeRIT system as per Nakagawa et al. 2023)."
<br>

<h3> In your Acknowledgements </h3>

Another option is to directly reference and cite Nakagawa et al 2023 and the MeRIT system in your acknowledgements section.
