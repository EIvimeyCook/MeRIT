     Below you will see a diagram illustrating how a combination of CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) and MeRIT (Method Reporting with Initials for Transparency) can make author contributions clearer and more granular than CRediT alone: 
      <br> 
      <br>
      A) without CRediT and MeRIT, one can only assume the first and/or last author would have written the text, but it cannot be certain abut this, 
      <br> 
      <br>
      B) CRediT can clarify some of the tasks authors did, but not all tasks, especially methodological ones, and 
      <br> 
      <br>
      C) the both use of CRediT and MeRIT together can clarify all author contributions.
